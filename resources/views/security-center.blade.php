                        <p>Seven Signs to Identify Fake Job Offers:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 15px">
                            <li>If you get a job offer without applying, be careful. Usually, real employers contact people who have applied for the job.</li>
                            <li>Look out for scams. If a job promises super high pay, needs very little work, or talks about quick promotions, beware.</li>
                            <li>Check the job details in detail. If something seems unclear, check it before going forward.</li>
                            <li>Be careful if job offers have bad grammar or use informal email addresses; it could be a scam.</li>
                            <li>If a recruiter pushes you to accept a job right away, be cautious.</li>
                            <li>Look for clear hiring criteria to make sure the job is real. Stay smart and safe!</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p>Protect Yourself from Job Frauds:</p>
                        <ul style="margin-left: 15px">
                            <li>Be cautious and check the hiring company first before confirming its legitimacy.</li>
                            <li>Never share personal information like bank details or passwords.</li>
                            <li>Say no if the job asks for payment.</li>
                            <li>Check the recruitment firm online and check for reviews. Stay safe and wise!</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>If you encounter any suspicious job offers, report them to our security team immediately: info@angel-jobs.mt.</p>
